### 1. T-SQL Concepts

- SQL and its variants (Oracle SQL, MySQL SQL, PostgreSQL SQL, etc)
- T-SQL Features (variables, control flow logic [if, while, etc], 
    error-handling [TRY...CATCH])
- Query Command Categories Overview (DDL, DML, SQL, DCL, TCL)
- Importing Flat Files (CSV, TXT, etc) into SQL Server
- Importing Excel Files into SQL Server
- Importing Data from Other Databases (e.g., Oracle, MySQL, etc) into SQL Server

### 2. SQL Server (T-SQL) Data Structure, Types and Constraints

- Database Objects (Tables, views, stored procedures, functions, etc)
- Tables, columns, rows, schemas and naming convention)
- SQL Server Data Types
- Null Concepts
- Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, IDENTITY, CHECK, DEFAULT, etc) 

### 3. T-SQL Fundamentals

-   Select statement and Basic Queries (Syntax, selecting columns, aliases, distinct, basic expressions and calculations) 
-   Filtering Data (WHERE clause, comparison and logical operators, between, in, like 
-   Sorting and Conditional Logic (ORDER BY, single and multi-column sorting, TOP & ORDER BY, OFFSET, FETCH, etc)
-   CASE expressions

### 4. Summary/Aggregation and Grouping

- Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX)
- Aggregation rules, Handling NULLs
- GROUP BY concepts
- HAVING vs WHERE
- Muli-level Grouping


### 5. DML - Data Manipulation Lang

- INSERT INTO
- UPDATE with joins
- DELETE with conditions
- Safety best practices


## INTERMEDIATE

### 6. Joins and Multi-level Queries

- Table relationships
- INNER JOIN, LEFT, RIGHT, OUTER, 
- UNION vs UNION ALL
- Join Best practices and mistakes, cardinality awareness


### 7. Subqueries and CTEs

- Subqueries (scalar vs multi-row subqueries; subqueries in SELECT, WHERE, FROM; Correlated Subqs) 
- CTEs (CTE syntax, Recursive CTEs, Readability vs Subqueries) 


### 8. Window Functions and Analytics

- OVER() clause
- PARTITION BY
- ORDER BY within windows
- ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK
- LAG, LEAD
- Running totals
- Moving Averages


### 9. Procedural Logic Control Flows

- Variables Declaration (DECLARE) and assignment (SET). 
- Code block (BEGIN, END) 
- IF condition
- WHILE loop


## ADVANCED

### 9  MERGE Statement

- UPSERT logic
- Synchronizing tables
- Common issues


### 10. Database Objects

- Views and Stored Procedure (syntax, creation, parameters, execution)
- OUTPUT parameters
- Built-in Functions (DateTime fns, Numeric fns, String fns, math fns, etc) 
- User-Defined functions (scalar fns, Table-valued fns, When to avoid fns) 


### 11. Database Trigger

- Trigger Concepts
- Trigger creation and execution (BEFORE, AFTER, etc commands)
- Best practices


### 12. Performance and Indexing

- Clustered vs Non-clustered
- When to index
- covering indexes


## ADVANCED ADDENDUM

### Transactions, Error Handling & Security

- Transactions (BEGIN, END, COMMIT, ROLLBACK) 
- TRY... CATCH error handling
- Basic Security concepts (roles, permissions, authorizations)
